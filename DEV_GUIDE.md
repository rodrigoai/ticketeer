# Ticketeer Vue.js Development Guide

## 🎯 Migration Complete!

The Ticketeer application has been successfully migrated from vanilla JavaScript to Vue.js 3 with the Composition API. The application now features:

- **Vue.js 3** with Composition API and `<script setup>`
- **Vue Router 4** for client-side routing
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds  
- **Bootstrap 5** integration maintained
- **Express.js** server serving the Vue SPA
- **Auth0** authentication integration
- **Responsive UI** components

## 🚀 Development Workflow

### Production Mode
```bash
# Build the Vue SPA
yarn build

# Start the Express server (serves built Vue SPA)
yarn start
# or
yarn dev
```

### Development Mode

For development, you have two options:

#### Option 1: Production Build + Express Server
```bash
# Build the Vue SPA
yarn build

# Start Express server
yarn start
```

#### Option 2: Vite Dev Server + Express Server (Recommended)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Vite dev server (with HMR)
yarn dev:client

# Terminal 2: Start Express server
yarn dev
```

With Option 2, the Vite dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173` with hot module replacement, and the Express server runs on `http://localhost:3000` for API calls. Vite proxies API calls to Express automatically.

4. **PWA**: Convert to Progressive Web App
5. **State Management**: Consider Pinia for complex state if needed
6. **UI Library**: Consider Vue-specific components like PrimeVue
7. **TypeScript**: Migrate to TypeScript for better type safety

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `yarn install`
- Clear node_modules if needed: `rm -rf node_modules && yarn install`

### Authentication Issues  
- Check Auth0 configuration in `.env`
- Verify domain and client ID settings
- Ensure callback URLs are configured in Auth0 dashboard

### API Issues
- Verify Express server is running on port 3000
- Check API endpoints in browser developer tools
- Ensure authentication is working for protected routes

Congratulations on the successful Vue.js migration! 🎉
